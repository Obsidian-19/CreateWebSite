    <h3>Step 3 - Create Files</h3>
    <p>The next step will be to create files to upload to your GitHub repository. To start you will need to download a code editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text) to create an HTML file to structure the content of the website. Additionally, you will need any images to also be saved in the directory location where your HTML file is located, so any embedded images can be resourced.</p>

    <h3>Step 4 - Commit Files to GitHub</h3>
    <p>Once your HTML file and supporting resources have been saved in a directory location, the next step will be to commit your files to your GitHub repository. In the repository you created previously, there will be a hyperlink in the middle of the page called "uploading an existing file"</p>

    <p>This will be where you upload your files for your website and "Commit" the changes to.</p>
